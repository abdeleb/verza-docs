import ClientTag from '@site/src/components/tags/ClientTag';

This event is triggered when a command is not found in any script, including both server and client scripts.

:::tip
It's recommended to use a single `onCommandNotFound` handler across all your server scripts to avoid duplicate help/error messages.
:::

| `command` | `string` | The command that was not found, excluding the slash. |

### Example

```js
engine.events.on('onCommandNotFound', command => {
  console.log(`command not found`, command);
});
