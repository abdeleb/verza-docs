import ClientTag from '@site/src/components/tags/ClientTag';
import ServerTag from '@site/src/components/tags/ServerTag';

This event is triggered when a script is synced with the server.

Usually when assets, player information, and other data is synced with the server.

If you're using the `EngineProvider` (<ClientTag />) component, you don't need to worry about handling the `onSynced` event. This is because the component internally waits for the `onSynced` event to be triggered before rendering its children.

### Example

```js
engine.events.on('onSynced', () => {
  console.log('Script is fully synced with the server!');

  // now you can use engine.localPlayer, engine.objects, etc safely.
});
```

**Available on:** <ClientTag /> <ServerTag />
