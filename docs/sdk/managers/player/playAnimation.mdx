import ClientTag from '@site/src/components/tags/ClientTag';
import ServerTag from '@site/src/components/tags/ServerTag';

Plays an animation on the player.

:::note Network Sync on Client and Server
When `networkSync` is set to `true`, the animation will be synced with other players. This means that other players will see the animation playing on the player

**Client:** Can only be used on the local player; using it on other players will have no effect.

**Server:** Can be used on any player.

You can have a maximum of `16` animations synced at the same time. If you try to sync more than `16` animations, an error will be thrown.
