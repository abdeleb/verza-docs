Plays an animation on the player.

:::note Network Sync on Client and Server
When `networkSync` is set to `true`, the animation will be synced with other players. This means that other players will see the animation playing on the player

**Client:** Can only be used on the local player; using it on other players will have no effect.

**Server:** Can be used on any player.
