import ClientTag from '@site/src/components/tags/ClientTag';

Requests a resources check.

Checks for the following resources:

- Scripts
- Objects

This is useful when you want to make sure that all resources are ready before allowing the player to move.

When the player connects to the server, the resources are automatically checked. However, if you add new resources while the player is connected, you will need to request a resources check.

:::note
After this method is called, the `onResourcesReady` event will be triggered when the resources are ready.

### Syntax

engine.requestResourcesCheck(freeze);

| -------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `freeze` | `boolean` | Freezes the player while the resources are being checked. |
