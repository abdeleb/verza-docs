Retrieves an object by its ID and returns a reference to the corresponding object manager.

This method is used to retrieve an object that has already been created, but for which you don't have a reference to the `ObjectManager` instance. This can be useful, for example, when the object was created by another script.

### Syntax

```js
engine.objects.resolveObject(object);
```

### Parameters

| Name           | Type      | Description                                                      |
| -------------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`           | `string`  | The ID of the object to retrieve                                 |
| `forceUpdate?` | `boolean` | Whether or not to force the object to update its data (optional) |

### Returns

- [`Promise<ObjectManager>`](/sdk/types/ObjectManager) - A promise that resolves to the reference to the `ObjectManager` instance for the specified object, or `null` if the object is not found.

### Example

```js title="script1.js"
const box = engine.objects.create('box', {
    id: 'my-box'
})

...
```

```js title="script2.js"
const box = await engine.objects.resolve('my-box');

...
```
