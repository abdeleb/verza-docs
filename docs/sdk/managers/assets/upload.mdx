import ClientTag from '@site/src/components/tags/ClientTag';

Uploads a file to Verza's CDN to be used as an asset in your script.

:::tip Usage Recommendation
Note that this feature is intended for game asset sharing only, and not intended to be used as a file storage service for assets unrelated to the game mode.

You can reuse the `asset_id` on as many objects as you want, which is useful for shared assets such as textures, models, and sounds. If you have a large file that you want to use in multiple places, you can upload it once and then use the same `asset_id` on all of the objects that need it.

If you need to store files other than game assets, it is recommended to use a dedicated file storage service such as [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) or [Cloudflare R2](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/r2/).

This method supports uploading any file type (`application/octet-stream`) like `png`, `jpg`, `gif`, `glb`, and `gltf`.
