# Enums

Enums in the Verza SDK are predefined sets of named constant values that represent specific categories or groups of related values. They provide a more readable and maintainable way to work with these values within your scripts, ensuring better code clarity and reducing the likelihood of errors.

In this section, you'll find a comprehensive list of enums available in the Verza SDK, along with descriptions of each constant value and their use cases. Familiarize yourself with these enums to make your script development process smoother and more efficient, and to enhance the overall quality of your game experiences.
