# 1. Design

Design is a crucial stage in creating an experience using verza. It sets the foundation for your experience and determines how people will engage with it. In this section, we'll explore key considerations and steps to guide you through the design process.

1. **What is going to motivate people to get into your experience?**<br />
   It's essential to identify the motivations behind. Consider what will draw people in and keep them engaged. Is it the challenge, the narrative, or the opportunity to socialize? Understanding the core motivations will help shape your design decisions.

2. **What aspects could people find enjoyable?**<br />
   Put yourself in the shoes of the people experiencing your experience. Identify the elements that could make it enjoyable for them. Is it the sense of progression and accomplishment, the immersive storytelling, the opportunities for creativity and customization, or the thrill of overcoming challenges? By understanding what aspects could be enjoyable to players, you can incorporate them into your design to create a captivating and satisfying experience.

3. **Define your experience on a piece of paper.**<br />
   Start by sketching your ideas on paper. Visualize the game mechanics, levels, characters, and any other elements relevant to your experience. This helps you conceptualize the overall structure and layout of your experience.

4. **Prototype: How do I get there?**<br />
   Prototyping is an iterative process where you create a basic version of your experience to test and refine your ideas. Start with simple, core mechanics and build upon them. Verza's JavaScript capabilities make it easy to create interactive prototypes in the browser. Experiment with different interactions, controls, and features to find what works best.

5. **Embrace failed prototypes.**<br />
   Don't be discouraged by unsuccessful prototypes. Learn from them! Failed prototypes provide valuable insights and help you understand what doesn't work. Embrace these lessons and iterate on your design accordingly.

6. **Define rules and paths.**<br />
   Establish clear rules for your experience. Define the goals, objectives, and win/lose conditions. Consider the paths players can take to achieve these goals. Will they have choices, or is there a linear progression? Define these pathways to give players a sense of direction and purpose.

7. **Make things approachable.**<br />
   Ensure your experience is approachable to players. Break down complex tasks into smaller, achievable goals. Provide tutorials, tooltips, or hints to guide players through the experience. By making your experience accessible, you'll create a positive user experience.

8. **Add constraints and limitations.**<br />
   Constraints and limitations can foster creativity and challenge players. Determine what constraints will exist within your experience. This could be time limits, limited resources, or specific gameplay mechanics. Constraints add depth and strategic thinking to the experience.

Designing your experience is a creative and iterative process. By considering motivations, embracing prototyping, defining rules and paths, and making your experience approachable yet challenging, you'll be on your way to creating an engaging experience on Verza. In the next sections, we'll delve into the building and deployment aspects to bring your experience to life.
