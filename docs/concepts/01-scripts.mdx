# Scripts

In Verza, there are three types of scripts that developers can use to create a wide range of custom experiences. These scripts can be used to handle logic and event triggers, execute custom functions, and interact with the network engine to provide real-time interaction and feedback.

## Client Scripts

`Client Scripts` are executed exclusively on the client-side and can be used to create a wide range of instant user feedback actions such as animations and effects. They are designed to provide a convenient way for developers to create custom experiences without requiring extensive server-side functionality.

## WebServer scripts

`WebServer Scripts` are lightweight server-side scripts that can receive commands and network events. They don't have to run 24/7 and work more like a serverless-like service. One of the advantages of using a server-side script is that you can secure the logic from potential bad actors and ensure the integrity of your gameplay's mechanics.

## WebsocketServer Scripts

`WebsocketServer Scripts` are full-running servers that receive events from the server in real-time. They can be used to create more robust logic, such as anti-cheat measures, and provide a more reliable experience for users. These scripts are ideal for developers who need more advanced functionality and want to build custom experiences that are not possible with traditional server-side scripting.

## Conclusion

Verza provides developers with three types of scripts for creating custom experiences on their server. These scripts can be used to handle logic, execute custom functions, and interact with the network engine. Whether you need real-time feedback on the client-side or robust server-side logic, Verza offers the flexibility to support your development needs. With these options, you can build secure and scalable experiences tailored to your vision.
