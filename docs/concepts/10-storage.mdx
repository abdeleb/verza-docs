# Storage

Verza offers two cloud-based storage options: the `Persistent Store` and the `Memory Store`. These storage solutions provide a secure and reliable way to store and retrieve data in your server.

The `Persistent Store` ensures long-term data storage across player sessions, while the `Memory Store` is ideal for temporary or transient data during a session. Both options utilize a key-value approach, allowing you to efficiently manage your server data.

Let's dive into the specifics of each storage option below.

## Persistent Store

The `Persistent Store` is designed for long-term storage of data that persists across player sessions. It is suitable for saving player progress, player settings, and other persistent data. The data stored in the `Persistent Store` will be available even if the server restarts or the player leaves and returns to the server.

You can get the `Persistent Store` instance by calling the [`storage.getPersistentStore`](/sdk/managers/storage/getPersistentStore) method.

### Limits

| Method                                                      | Rate Limit                               |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| [`store.set`](/sdk/managers/storage/persistent/set)         | `100 + players * 10` requests per minute |
| [`store.get`](/sdk/managers/storage/persistent/get)         | `100 + players * 10` requests per minute |
| [`store.delete`](/sdk/managers/storage/persistent/delete)   | `100 + players * 10` requests per minute |
| [`store.getList`](/sdk/managers/storage/persistent/getList) | `100 + players * 10` requests per minute |

Rate limiting is implemented to ensure fair usage of storage operations. In some cases, rate limiting allows for short bursts of traffic, allowing a temporary increase in the number of requests within a specific timeframe.

**Key Max Length:** Maximum key length for the `Persistent Store` is `64` characters.

**Value Max Size:** Maximum value size for the `Persistent Store` is `4MB`.

## Memory Store

The `Memory Store` is designed for temporary or transient storage of data that is only needed during a player session. It is suitable for storing temporary variables, caching frequently accessed data, and other short-lived data. The data stored in the Memory Store will be lost when the server restarts or the player leaves the server.

You can get the `Memory Store` instance by calling the [`storage.getPersistentStore`](/sdk/managers/storage/getMemoryStore) method.

### Limits

| Method                                                | Rate Limit                                 |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| [`store.set`](/sdk/managers/storage/memory/set)       | `1000 + players * 100` requests per minute |
| [`store.get`](/sdk/managers/storage/memory/get)       | `1000 + players * 100` requests per minute |
| [`store.delete`](/sdk/managers/storage/memory/delete) | `1000 + players * 100` requests per minute |

Rate limiting is implemented to ensure fair usage of storage operations. In some cases, rate limiting allows for short bursts of traffic, allowing a temporary increase in the number of requests within a specific timeframe.

**Key Max Length:** Maximum key length for the `Memory Store` is `64` characters.

**Value Max Size:** Maximum value size for the `Memory Store` is `1K` (`1024 bytes`).

## Access

`Write` access to a store is limited to [`WebServer Script`](/concepts/scripts), [`WebsocketServer Scripts`](/concepts/scripts) or `Admin Players`.

`Read` access is allowed from any player by default, to restrict access to a store you need to add the suffix `private` to the scope of the store, for example `scores.private` or `scores:private` will only be accessible to the `Admin Players` and `Server Scripts`.

**This table shows the different scenarios for a `Player` without `Admin` access accessing a store:**

| Scope                        | Read | Write | Description                                              |
| ---------------------------- | ---- | ----- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `global`                     | ✅   | ❌    | Accessible to all players (default scope).               |
| `scores`                     | ✅   | ❌    | Accessible to all players (custom scope).                |
| `scores.[PLAYER_ID]`         | ✅   | ❌    | Accessible to all players (custom scope).                |
| `private`                    | ❌   | ❌    | Accessible only to `Admin Players` and `Server Scripts`. |
| `scores.private`             | ❌   | ❌    | Accessible only to `Admin Players` and `Server Scripts`. |
| `scores.[PLAYER_ID].private` | ❌   | ❌    | Accessible only to `Admin Players` and `Server Scripts`. |

_The `[PLAYER_ID]` is a placeholder for the player id, for example, `scores.1234` or `scores.1234.private`._

:::caution Scope Naming
Scopes are case insensitive, `scores` and `Scores` are the same scope.

Scopes are unique, for example, `scores` to `scores:private` are different scopes and will not share the same data.

You can't convert a scope from `public` to `private` or vice versa, you need to create a new scope and copy the data.

## Recommendations

When using our storage service, we want to ensure that you have the best experience without worrying about infrastructure management. Here are some recommendations to help you make the most of our storage capabilities:

- While there are no strict limits, it's a good practice to avoid storing excessively large amounts of data.
- Create a strategy for frequently accessed data to avoid unnecessary storage operations (e.g., when the player joins the server).
- If you need to store large amounts of data, consider using a dedicated database service.
- By being mindful of data usage, you can optimize the performance of our storage service.
- Avoid storing sensitive data such as credit card numbers, billing information, or other personally identifiable information (PII).
- Avoid storing data that is not relevant to your server.
