# Lighting

Implementing lighting is a crucial aspect of creating immersive and visually appealing experiences in any game. With Verza, you have full control over the lighting in your world, enabling you to create dynamic and engaging environments that captivate players and elevate the overall experience.

## Lighting

You can set up lighting in your world using point and spot lights. You can also customize the intensity, color, and position of each light, giving you complete control over the look and feel of your world. Additionally, Verza supports real-time lighting, which means that lights can be animated and updated dynamically in response to changes in the environment.

It is recommended to use baked lighting wherever possible, as this can greatly improve performance and reduce the number of dynamic lights needed in a scene.

## Native Sky vs Skybox

In Verza, you have the option to use either the `Native Sky` or a `Skybox` to create the sky environment in your server.

The `Native Sky` is a dynamic system that can be configured to show different times of day and weather conditions.

The `Skybox` is a pre-rendered 2D image that is used to create the sky environment.

`Native Sky` is just as fast as the `Skybox` approach, with no major performance impact. Additionally, regardless of whether you use a skybox or the native sky, the environment map will use the selected sky.
