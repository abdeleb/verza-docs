# Assets

Assets are the files that are used in your project, such as textures, models, animations and sounds.

## Asset Types

| Asset Type  | Format                   | Description     |
| ----------- | ------------------------ | --------------- |
| `Texture`   | `png` `jpg` `jpeg` `hdr` | A 2D image.     |
| `Model`     | `glb` `gltf`             | A 3D model.     |
| `Animation` | `glb` `gltf`             | A 3D animation. |
| `Sound`     | `mp3`                    | A sound.        |

## Assets Manager

The [`AssetsManager`](/sdk/managers/#assetsmanager) is used to upload files to Verza's servers to be used as an asset in your script.

Use the [`assets.upload`](/sdk/managers/assets/upload) method to upload a file to Verza's servers.

```js
const assetId = await engine.assets.upload(file);
```

After the file has been uploaded, you can use the returned `assetId` anywhere in your scripts to reference the asset.

## Assets in GLTF Models

The `name` attribute of a mesh can be used to control the `bloom`, `shadows` and `collision` of a mesh from a GLTF model.

### Attribute Specifications

Each attribute is separated by a `|` character.

```
bloom_on
shadows_on
collision_on
```

### Practical Examples

Bloom, shadows and collision: `MyBox|bloom_on|shadows_on|collision_on`

Bloom and shadows: `MyBox|bloom_on|shadows_on`

Only Bloom: `MyBox|bloom_on`
