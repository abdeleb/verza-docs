# Voicechat

The voicechat system allows players to communicate with each other using their microphone.

The SDK offers a variety of methods to control the voicechat system, from walkie-talkie style to proximity-based voicechat or a combination of both.

## Modes

The voicechat system supports two modes: **`global`** and **`proximity`**

| Mode        | Description                                                                                |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `global`    | All players can hear each other regardless of their distance.                              |
| `proximity` | Players can only hear each other if they are close enough based on the `distance` setting. |

## Channels

By default, all players are in the same voicechat channel `0`.

You can enable and disable different channels by using the [player.enableChannel](/sdk/managers/player/voicechat/enableChannel) and [player.disableChannel](/sdk/managers/player/voicechat/disableChannel) methods respectively.

## Global and Per Player settings

The voicechat system can be controlled globally or per player.

When using a player method, the global setting will be overridden for that player.

If the voicechat is disabled globally using [voicechat.setEnabled](/sdk/managers/voicechat/setEnabled), you can't enable it for a specific player. To achieve this, you can use the [player.voicechat.setMuted](/sdk/managers/player/voicechat/setMuted) or removing the player from all (or specific) channels using [player.voicechat.disableChannel](/sdk/managers/player/voicechat/disableChannel).

| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| [`voicechat.setEnabled`](/sdk/managers/voicechat/setEnabled)                                      | Sets the global voicechat status.            |
| [`voicechat.setMode`](/sdk/managers/voicechat/setMode)                                            | Sets the global voicechat mode.              |
| [`voicechat.setDistance`](/sdk/managers/voicechat/setDistance)                                    | Sets the global voicechat distance.          |
| [`player.voicechat.setPlayerToPlayerMode` ](/sdk/managers/player/voicechat/setPlayerToPlayerMode) | Sets the voicechat mode to player to player. |
| [`player.voicechat.enableChannel`](/sdk/managers/player/voicechat/enableChannel)                  | Enables a voicechat channel.                 |
| [`player.voicechat.disableChannel`](/sdk/managers/player/voicechat/disableChannel)                | Disables a voicechat channel.                |
| [`player.voicechat.setMuted`](/sdk/managers/player/voicechat/setMuted)                            | Sets the player's muted status.              |
| [`player.voicechat.setDistance`](/sdk/managers/player/voicechat/setDistance)                      | Sets the player's voicechat distance.        |

## Server settings

Basic configuration of the voicechat system like the global [VoicechatModeType](/sdk/types/VoicechatModeType), `distance` and `status` can be done in the `Communication` tab of the `Server Settings`.

## Mute Players

A player can be muted for all players using the [player.voicechat.setMuted](/sdk/managers/player/voicechat/setMuted) method.

At the same time local players can mute other players from the players list by clicking on the speaker icon:
