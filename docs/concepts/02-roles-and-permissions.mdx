# Roles and Permissions

Verza's platform includes a roles and permissions system that can be integrated with the commands and actions to control access. Roles are used to group players based on their permissions, and permissions are used to control what actions players can perform. This allows for fine-grained control over who can use which commands and access certain features of the platform, as well as custom logics via [`player.hasAccess`](/sdk/managers/player/hasAccess) or [`player.hasRole`](/sdk/managers/player/hasRole).

## Managing Roles

To manage roles, go to the `Roles` tab from the `Server Settings`. From there, you can create new roles, edit existing ones, and assign roles to players.

You can also assign roles to players via scripts using the [`player.addRole`](/sdk/managers/player/addRole) and [`player.removeRole`](/sdk/managers/player/removeRole) methods from a server script.

Please note that roles can only be created from the `Server Settings UI` and cannot be created via scripts at the moment.

## Managing Permissions

In Verza, permissions for commands and actions are defined by the name of the command or action itself. For example, if you create a command called `admin`, the permission required to access that command will also be called `admin`.

To manage permissions, go to the `Commands & Actions` tab from from the `Server Settings`.

Once you're in the `Server Settings UI`, click on the `Commands & Actions` tab to see a list of all the available commands. For each command, you can assign a specific role that is required to access it. This means that only players with that role will be able to use the command.

To assign a role to a command, simply click on the role dropdown next to the command and select the desired role from the list. You can assign multiple roles to a command if you want to allow multiple groups of players to access it.

You can also assign roles to players from the `Members` tab:

## Commands vs Actions

`Commands` and `Actions` are both ways to define player interactions in Verza. `Commands` are messages prefixed with a slash (`/`) in the chat that trigger predefined functionality, while `Actions` are used to grant or restrict access to certain functionality programmatically.

For example:

**Command**: `/kick player1` - Kicks `player1` from the server.

**Actions**: `player.hasAccess('+miner')` - Checks if the player has access to the `+miner` action.

Think of `Commands` as something that players can trigger directly, while `Actions` are used to control access to functionality based on a player's assigned roles.

You can check if a player has access to a specific command or action using the [`player.hasAccess`](/sdk/managers/player/hasAccess) method.

### Commands

Commands are created using the [`Command`](/sdk/types/Command) class, and can be registered with the [`commands.register`](/sdk/managers/commands/register) method. `Commands` are identified by a unique name, and can be executed by players by typing the name preceded by a slash (`/`) in the chat like so: `/fireworks`.

### Actions

`Actions` are not triggered by players directly, but are used to grant or restrict access to functionality based on a player's assigned roles. Actions are essentially just permissions that can be checked using the [`player.hasAccess`](/sdk/managers/player/hasAccess) method. For example, if a player has been assigned the `admin` role, which grants access to the `+kick` action, they can use the `player.hasAccess('+kick')` method to check if they have permission to kick another player.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, commands are used to trigger predefined functionality, while actions are used to control access to functionality based on a player's assigned roles.

## Special Admin Role

The `Admin` role is a special role that is automatically created when you create a new server. This role is assigned to the server owner by default and has the name `Owner`, it grants access to specific server-side-only actions from the client.

You can identify the `Admin` special role by its tag along with the `Admin` name like in the following screenshot.

![Admin Role](https://i.gyazo.com/0b15924d7b87a1f95e53f2640492c41c.png)

By default the name of the role is `Owner`, you can change it to whatever you want, however the role will always be `Admin`.

As mentioned above, the `Admin` role grants access to specific server-side-only actions from the client. These actions are listed below:

## Special Actions

There are certain actions that are automatically created when you create a new server.

This will help to access certain server-side actions from the client when the player has access to these actions.

These actions are listed below:

### Objects
