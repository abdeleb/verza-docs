# Roles and Permissions

Verza's platform includes a roles and permissions system that can be integrated with the commands and actions to control access. Roles are used to group players based on their permissions, and permissions are used to control what actions players can perform. This allows for fine-grained control over who can use which commands and access certain features of the platform, as well as custom logics via [`player.hasAccess`](/sdk/methods/player/hasAccess) or [`player.hasRole`](/sdk/methods/player/hasRole).

The roles and permissions system is highly customizable, allowing you to create roles and assign specific permissions to each role. This ensures that players are only able to access the features and commands that are appropriate for their level of access. Additionally, you can easily manage roles and permissions through the use of simple commands and configuration files.

## Managing Roles

To manage roles, you can access the server settings in the `Verza UI` and navigate to the Roles section. From there, you can create new roles, edit existing ones, and assign roles to players. You can also assign roles to players via scripts using the [`player.addRole`](/sdk/methods/player/addRole) and [`player.removeRole`](/sdk/methods/player/removeRole) methods from a server script.

## Managing Permissions

In Verza, permissions for commands and actions are defined by the name of the command or action itself. For example, if you create a command called `admin`, the permission required to access that command will also be called `admin`.

To manage permissions, you can configure them from the `Server Settings UI` by assigning them to specific roles. You can access the `Server Settings UI` by pressing the `K` key while in-game, or by navigating to the `Server Settings` section of the `Options Menu`.

Once you're in the `Server Settings UI`, click on the `Commands` tab to see a list of all the available commands. For each command, you can assign a specific role that is required to access it. This means that only players with that role will be able to use the command.

To assign a role to a command, simply click on the role dropdown next to the command and select the desired role from the list. You can assign multiple roles to a command if you want to allow multiple groups of players to access it.

## Commands vs Actions

`Commands` and `Actions` are both ways to define player interactions in Verza. `Commands` are messages sent by players in the chat that trigger predefined functionality, while `Actions` are used to grant or restrict access to certain functionality.

### Commands

Commands are created using the [`Command`](/sdk/types/Command) class, and can be registered with the [`engine.commands.register`](/sdk/methods/commands/register) method. `Commands` are identified by a unique name, and can be executed by players by typing the name preceded by a slash (`/`) in the chat.

### Actions

`Actions` are not triggered by players directly, but are used to grant or restrict access to functionality based on a player's assigned roles. Actions are essentially just permissions that can be checked using the [`player.hasAccess`](/sdk/methods/player/hasAccess) method. For example, if a player has been assigned the `admin` role, which grants access to the `+kick` action, they can use the `player.hasAccess('+kick')` method to check if they have permission to kick another player.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, commands are used to trigger predefined functionality, while actions are used to control access to functionality based on a player's assigned roles.
