# Physics

Implementing realistic physics and collision detection is an essential aspect of creating an immersive and interactive gaming experience. The Verza SDK provides built-in support for physics and collision detection to help you achieve realistic object interactions within your scripts.

In this section, we will cover the following topics:

- **Rigidbodies**: Learn how to add rigidbodies to objects in your world, enabling them to be affected by physics forces like gravity and interact with other objects.
- **Colliders**: Understand how to add colliders to objects, defining their shape for the purpose of physics calculations and interactions.
- **Raycasting**: Discover how to use raycasting to detect intersections between rays and colliders, enabling you to perform actions based on the detected collisions.

By understanding and applying these concepts, you can create a wide range of realistic interactions and gameplay mechanics, enhancing the overall experience for your players

## Rigidbodies

Rigidbodies are used to represent objects that can be affected by physics forces like gravity and can interact with other objects in the world. By adding a rigidbody component to an object, you enable it to participate in the physics simulation.

To add a rigidbody to an object, you need to set its `collision` property and configure its physics properties such as `mass`, `friction`, and `restitution`.

Here's an example of how to add a rigidbody to an object:

```js
const box = engine.objects.create('box', {
  collision: 'dynamic',
  mass: 1,
  friction: 0.5,
  restitution: 0.7,
});
```

In this example, we create a new object called `box` and set its `collision` property to `dynamic`. The `mass`, `friction`, and `restitution` properties determine how the object behaves within the physics simulation.

## Colliders

Colliders are used to define the shape and size of an object's collision area. By attaching a collider to an object, you allow it to detect and respond to collisions with other objects in the world. Colliders can be added to both static and dynamic objects.

When creating an object, you can set the `collider` property to define the collider's shape and size. Verza SDK supports several types of colliders such as box, sphere, and capsule.

Here's an example of how to add a collider to an object:

```js
const myObject = engine.objects.create('box', {
  width: 1,
  height: 1,
  depth: 1,
  collider: 'box',
});
```

In this example, we create a new object called box and set its collider property to a box collider with a size of 1x1x1 units. The object will now be able to detect and respond to collisions with other objects that have colliders.

## Raycasting

Raycasting is a technique used to detect collisions or intersections along a line, usually emanating from a point in 3D space. You can use raycasting to query the environment, detect collisions, and perform various other tasks. The SDK provides three methods for raycasting: `raycastPoint`, `raycastPoints`, and `raycastScreenPoint`.

| Method                                                                   | Description                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`raycastPoint`](/sdk/managers/world/raycaster/raycastPoint)             | Casts a ray from an origin and a direction in the world and returns the hit information. |
| [`raycastPoints`](/sdk/managers/world/raycaster/raycastPoints)           | Casts rays from two positions in the world and returns hit information.                  |
| [`raycastScreenPoint`](/sdk/managers/world/raycaster/raycastScreenPoint) | Casts a ray from a point on the screen and returns the hit information.                  |

These methods allow you to perform various tasks like querying the environment, detecting collisions, and more, using raycasting.
