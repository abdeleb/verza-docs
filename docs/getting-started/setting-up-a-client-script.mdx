# Setting up a Client Script

**Client Scripts** in Verza are HTML files, allowing them to draw UI components over the Verza interface, interacting with players, objects, and much more.

To enhance your development experience and take advantage of additional features, we recommend using a framework like [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) or [Remix](https://remix.run/).

## Setup Project

In this section, we'll guide you through setting up a `Client Script` project using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

1. **Install Next.js**: If you haven't already, please [visit the Next.js docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started) and follow the instructions to install **Next.js**.

2. **Install Verza SDK**: Install the Verza SDK in your project:

```bash
npm install @verza/sdk
```

3. **Create a client script:** In the `pages` folder, create a new file called `client.js`. This file will serve as the starting point for your game mode's client-side script.

Here's an example of a simple script that sends a welcome message to the game chat:

```jsx
import {useEffect} from 'react';

import {EngineProvider, useEngine} from '@verza/sdk/react';

const ClientScript = () => {
  return (
    <EngineProvider>
      <Script />
    </EngineProvider>
  );
};

const Script = () => {
  const engine = useEngine();

  useEffect(() => {
    engine.localPlayer.sendMessage('Welcome to my server!');
  }, [engine]);

  return null;
};

export default ClientScript;
```

4. **Start the development server:** Run the following command to start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

5. **Add the script to your server:** Add the script to your server by going to the **Scripts** tab in your server's settings and clicking **Add Script**. Then, enter the URL of your script (`http://localhost:3000/client`)

With these steps, you have set up a basic client script project using Next.js and the Verza SDK. You're now ready to explore the SDK features and start developing your game mode.
