# Setup WebServer Script

`WebServer Scripts` are lightweight server-side scripts that can receive commands and network events. They don't have to run 24/7 and work more like a serverless service.

See the [different types of scripts here](/concepts/scripts).

:::note
A `WebServer Script` always requires a `Client Script` to be connected to it. The `Client Script` is responsible for sending commands and network events to the `WebServer Script`.
:::

## Requirements

- Basic knowledge of JavaScript and Git
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v16 or higher)

## Obtain your `Access Token`

In order to connect your `WebServer Script`, you need to obtain your server's `Access Token`.

To obtain your server's `Access Token`, go to its `Server Settings` and click on the `Access Token` tab. Then click the `Generate Access Token` button to generate a new token and copy it.

## Create WebServer Script

The following steps assume that you have already created a `Client Script`. If you haven't, please refer to the [Setup Client Script](/getting-started/setup-client-script) guide.

### Edit Client Script

In your `src/client/script.js` file, replace with the following code:

```jsx title="src/client/script.js"
import {initEngine} from '@verza/sdk';

export default async function script(id: string) {
  const engine = await initEngine({
    id,
    webServer: new URL(import.meta.url).origin + '/server/script',
  });

  engine.network.emitToServer('onRequestWelcome');
}
```

### Edit WebServer Script

Replace with the following code your `src/server/script.js` file, also replace the `ACCESS_TOKEN` with your server's access token:

```jsx title="src/server/script.js"
import {initEngine} from '@verza/sdk';

export default async function script() {
  const engine = await initEngine({
    accessToken: 'ACCESS_TOKEN',
  });

  // add custom event
  engine.network.onPlayerEvent('onRequestWelcome', async () => {
    engine.localPlayer.sendMessage(`Message received! Welcome to the server!`);
  });
}
```

## Add to Server

To add the Script to your server, go to the **Scripts** tab in your **Server's Settings**. Then, enter the URL of your script and click on `Connect Script`.

By default, the URL of your script in development mode is `http://localhost:8085/script`
