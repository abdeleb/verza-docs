# Setup WebServer Script

`WebServer Scripts` are lightweight server-side scripts that can receive commands and network events. They don't have to run 24/7 and work more like a serverless-like service. One of the advantages of using a server-side script is that you can secure the logic from potential bad actors and ensure the integrity of your gameplay's mechanics.

See the [different types of scripts here](/concepts/scripts).

To enhance your development experience and take advantage of additional features, we recommend using a framework like [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) or [Remix](https://remix.run/).

:::note
A WebServer script always requires a client-side script to be connected to it. The client-side script is responsible for sending commands and network events to the web server-side script.

## Setup Project

In this section, we'll guide you through setting up a `WebServer Script` project using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

1. **Install Next.js**: If you haven't already, please [visit the Next.js docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started) and follow the instructions to install **Next.js**.

2. **Install Verza SDK**: Install the Verza SDK in your project:

```bash
npm install @verza/sdk
```

3. **Create a client script:** In the `pages` folder, create a new file called `client.js`. This file will serve as the starting point for your game mode's client-side script.

```jsx title="client.js"
import {useEffect} from 'react';

import {EngineProvider, useEngine} from '@verza/sdk/react';

const ClientScript = () => {
  return (
    <EngineProvider
      params={{
        webServer: 'api/server', // specify the URL of your WebServer script
      }}>
      <Script />
    </EngineProvider>
  );
};

const Script = () => {
  const engine = useEngine();

  useEffect(() => {
    engine.network.emitServerEvent('onRequestWelcome');
  }, [engine]);

  return null;
};

export default ClientScript;
```

4. **Create a server script:** In the `api` folder, create a new file called `server.js`. This file will serve as the starting point for your game mode's client-side script.

To obtain your server's `Access Token`, go to its `Server Settings` and click on the `Access Token` tab.

```jsx title="server.js"
import {EngineManager} from '@verza/sdk';

export default async function handler(req, res) {
  // allow only POST packets
  if (req.method !== 'POST') {
    res.status(200).json({success: false});
    return;
  }

  // create server
  const engine = createWebServer(engine);

  // handle request
  const response = await engine.api.handleWebServer(req.body);

  // return response
  res.status(200).json(response);
}

export const createWebServer = () => {
  // init verza engine
  const engine = new EngineManager({
    name: 'Web Server',

    accessToken: 'ACCESS_TOKEN',
  });

  // event listener
  engine.network.onPlayerEvent('onRequestWelcome', async () => {
    engine.localPlayer.sendMessage(`Message received! Welcome to the server!`);
  });

  return engine;
};
```

5. **Start the development server:** Run the following command to start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

6. **Add the script to your server:** Add the script to your server by going to the **Scripts** tab in your **Server's Settings**. Then, enter the URL of your script (`http://localhost:3000/client`) and click on `Connect Script`.

With these steps, you have set up a basic `Webserver Script` project using Next.js and the Verza SDK.
