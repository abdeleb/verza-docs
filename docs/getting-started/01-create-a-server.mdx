# Create a Server

Before you can add and interact with scripts, you'll need to create a server in Verza. Creating a server is a straightforward process that can be done directly from the Verza player interface.

:::tip It's free ðŸŽ‰!
**Servers in Verza are free.**

There is no limit of players, usage, scripts, or servers you can have.

**Note:** You must be logged in to create a server. If you don't have an account, you can [create one here](https://verza.io/login).

**Follow the steps below to create a server:**

1. **Navigate to the Servers page:** Once you're logged in, go to the [Server Creation Page](https://verza.io/servers/create).

2. **Server Name & Privacy:** Fill in the server name and select the privacy settings for your server. You can always change these settings later.
