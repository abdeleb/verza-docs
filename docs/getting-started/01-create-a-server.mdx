# Create a Server

Before you can add and interact with scripts, you'll need to create a server in Verza. Creating a server is a straightforward process that can be done directly from the Verza player interface.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to create a server:

1. **Navigate to the Servers page:** Once you're logged in, go to the [Server Creation Page](https://verza.io/servers/create).

2. **Server Name:** Fill in the server name.

3. **Configure your server:** You can customize the server settings, such as logo and roles. You can always change these settings later.

Congratulations! You have now created a server in Verza. You can now add scripts, configure settings, and start developing your game mode.

Remember, to add a **Client Script** to your server, you can include the **Client Script URL** in your **Server's Settings** under the **Scripts** tab.
