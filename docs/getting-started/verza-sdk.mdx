# Verza SDK

**Verza's SDK** is designed to be **framework-agnostic**, meaning you can use it with any frontend (React, Vue, etc.) or backend framework. This provides maximum flexibility and allows you to use your preferred tools when building your game modes.

To install the **Verza SDK**, run the following command:

```bash
npm install @verza/sdk
```

Now that you've installed the **SDK**, you can proceed with setting up your project structure and exploring the SDK's features. Happy developing! ðŸ§±

:::tip

We recommend using **React** for **Client Scripts**, as our **SDK** supports a declarative entities rendering approach based on components. This makes it easier to create and manage game entities using **React** components like `<Box />` or `<Gltf />` instead of imperative methods such as `objects.create('box', ...)`, which require manual handling of entities destruction.
