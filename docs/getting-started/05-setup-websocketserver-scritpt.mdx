# Setup WebsocketServer Script

`WebsocketServer Scripts` are full-running servers that receive events from the server in real-time. They can be used to create more robust logic, such as anti-cheat measures, and provide a more reliable experience for users. These scripts are ideal for developers who need more advanced functionality and want to build custom experiences that are not possible with traditional server-side scripting.

See the [different types of scripts here](/concepts/scripts).

## Setup WebsocketServer Script

### 1. Install SDK

Install the Verza SDK in your script:

```bash
npm install @verza/sdk
```

### 2. Obtain your `Access Token`

In order to connect your web `WebsocketServer Script`, you need to obtain your server's `Access Token`.

To obtain your server's `Access Token`, go to its `Server Settings` and click on the `Access Token` tab. Then click the `Generate Access Token` button to generate a new token.

### 3. Create a server script:

Create a file called `server.js`.

```jsx title="server.js"
import {EngineManager} from '@verza/sdk';
const engine = new EngineManager({
  name: 'Websocket Server',

  accessToken: 'ACCESS_TOKEN',
});

engine.connectServer();

const onSynced = engine.events.on('onSynced', async () => {
  console.log('Websocket server ready!');
});
```

### 4. Start the server:

```bash
node server.js
```

## Keep the server running

Sometimes, the server may crash or stop running, this can be due to a variety of reasons, such as a bug in the script or a server restart, to prevent this from happening, you can use a process manager to keep the server running when it crashes or stops.

You can use a process manager like [Forever](https://www.npmjs.com/package/forever) or [PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/).

### Using Forever

```bash
npm install -g forever

# Start the server
forever start server.js

# Stop the server
forever stop server.js
```

### Using PM2

```bash
npm install -g pm2

# Start the server
pm2 start server.js

# Stop the server
pm2 stop server.js
```

With these steps, you have set up a basic `WebsocketServer Script` using the Verza SDK.
