# Setup Websocket Server Script

`WebsocketServer Scripts` are full-running servers that receive events from the server in real-time. They can be used to create more robust logic, such as anti-cheat measures, and provide a more reliable experience for users. These scripts are ideal for developers who need more advanced functionality and want to build custom experiences that are not possible with traditional server-side scripting.

See the [different types of scripts here](/concepts/scripts).

## Setup Project

1. **Install Verza SDK**: Install the Verza SDK in your project:

```bash
npm install @verza/sdk
```

3. **Create a server script:** Create a file called `server.js`.

To obtain your server's `Access Token`, go to its `Server Settings` and click on the `Access Token` tab.

```jsx title="server.js"
import {EngineManager} from '@verza/sdk';
const engine = new EngineManager({
  name: 'Websocket Server',

  accessToken: 'ACCESS_TOKEN',
});

engine.connectServer();

const onSynced = engine.events.on('onSynced', async () => {
  console.log('Websocket server ready!');
});
```

5. Start the server:

```bash
node server.js
```

With these steps, you have set up a basic `Websocket Server Script` using the Verza SDK.
