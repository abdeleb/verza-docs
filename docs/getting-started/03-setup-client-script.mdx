# Setup Client Script

`Client Scripts` in Verza are JavaScript files, from creating a beatiful UI to animating objects adding interactivity to your server.

See the [different types of scripts here](/concepts/scripts).

## What Are We Building?

By the end of this guide, you'll have a `Client Script` that looks like this with a box that moves from left to right back and forth.

## Requirements

- Basic knowledge of JavaScript and Git
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v16 or higher)

## Verza Create CLI

`Verza Create CLI` is a command-line tool that allows you to create a new project with a `Client Script` or `Server Script` already setup.

You will get out of the box:

- üìú The template of your choice (`JavaScript`, `TypeScript` aornd `React`)
- üî• Hot reloading for your scripts.
- üöÄ Deploy support for [`Cloudflare Pages`](https://pages.cloudflare.com) or [`Vercel`](https://vercel.com) for `Client` and `WebServer` scripts.
- üè∑Ô∏è Auto-versioning for your scripts when deploying a new change.
- ‚öôÔ∏è [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) as the build tool

:::info
`Verza Create CLI` uses the powerful and simple [Vite build tool](https://vitejs.dev). Any Vite plugins can be used in your project üéâ.
:::

**With NPM:**

```bash
npm create verza@latest

# or

npm create verza@latest <template> <project-name>
```

**With Yarn:**

```bash
yarn create verza

# or

yarn create verza <template> <project-name>
```

**With PNPM:**

```bash
pnpm create verza

# or

pnpm create verza <template> <project-name>
```

## Creating a New Project

### Create a New Project

Create a new project using the `Verza Create CLI`:

```bash
npm create verza@latest javascript my-project
cd my-project
npm install
```

### Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

By default, the server will run on [`http://localhost:8085`](http://localhost:8085). You can change the port and more in the `verza.config.ts` file, check out the [Vite docs](https://vitejs.dev/config/) for more information.

### Project Structure

| Folder/File                         | Description                                                 |
| :---------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/public`                           | Contains all the static files for your project.             |
| `/src`                              | Contains all the source code for your project.              |
| `/src/client`                       | Contains all the client scripts for your project.           |
| `/src/server`                       | Contains all the server scripts for your project.           |
| `.gitignore`                        | Contains the files and folders to be ignored by git.        |
| `package.json`                      | Contains the dependencies and scripts for your project.     |
| `.eslintrc.cjs` _(React Only)_      | Contains the configuration for the ESLint linter.           |
| `tsconfig.json` _(TypeScript Only)_ | Contains the configuration for the TypeScript compiler.     |
| `verza.config.js`                   | Contains the configuration for the Verza & Vite build tool. |

### Routing

Routes is the way to define the URL of your scripts, the verza server will use the route to load the script.

You can define the routes for your scripts by creating a folder with the name of the route in the `src/client/script-name/script.js` format.

For example, if you want to create a script for the `/interactions` route, you will create a folder called `interactions` in the `src/client` folder and inside that folder, you will create a `script.js` file.

```ts
Script Path: /src/client/interactions/script.js
Script URL: http://localhost:8085/interactions
```

The same applies to the `src/server` folder, but usually, you will want to have one script in the `src/server` folder, see the [Setup WebServer Script](/getting-started/setup-websocketserver-script) guide for more information.

### Scripts Versioning

You don't need to worry about versioning your scripts, the Verza build tool will automatically version your scripts when you deploy a new version.

On each new deployment, the Verza build tool will create a version of each script and will add a redirect to the latest version of the script, so you can keep using the same URL (route) for your scripts.

### Edit Script

In the `src/client` folder, you'll find a `script.js` file that contains the code for your script.

You will see a simple script that creates a box by default.

Let's replace the code with the following that creates a box that moves from left to right back and forth.

```js title="/src/client/script.js"
import {initEngine} from '@verza/sdk';

export default function script(id) {
  const engine = await initEngine(id);

  engine.localPlayer.sendMessage('Welcome to my server!');

  const box = engine.objects.create('box', {
    color: 'red',
    position: [-2, 2, 5],
    collision: 'static',
  });

  box.startTransitions([
    {
      to: [-2, 2, 5],
      toRotation: [0, 0, 0],
      duration: 1000,
      easing: 'easeInOutQuad',
      loop: true,
    },

    {
      to: [2, 2, 5],
      toRotation: [0, Math.PI, 0],
      duration: 1000,
      easing: 'easeInOutQuad',
      loop: true,
    },
  ]);
}
```

:::note
Each script needs a default function that will be called when the script is loaded in the server.

The default function for `Client Scripts` receives the `id` parameter that is used to initialize the engine manager.

This `id` is unique for each script and it's used to identify the script in the server.
:::

## Add to Server

To add the Script to your server, go to the **Scripts** tab in your **Server's Settings**. Then, enter the URL of your script and click on `Connect Script`.

By default, the URL of your script in development mode is `http://localhost:8085/script`

## Deploy

Verza supports deploying your scripts to different platforms, you can deploy your scripts to:

| Platform                                         | Github Integration | Pricing            |
| :----------------------------------------------- | :----------------- | :----------------- |
| [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com) | ‚úÖ                 | Free (Recommended) |
| [Vercel](https://vercel.com)                     | ‚úÖ                 | Free               |

### Deploy to Cloudflare Pages

1. Upload your project to [`Github`](https://github.com) or [`Gitlab`](https://gitlab.com)

2. Connect your `Github` or `Gitlab` account to [`Cloudflare Pages`](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) from `Workers & Pages > Overview > Create Application > Pages -> Connect Git`

3. Select your repository and set the configuration as follows:

![Cloudflare Pages Configuration](https://i.gyazo.com/36b51ffbe01b2892623262af5c998e9f.png)

4. Copy the generated URL from `Cloudflare Pages` and connect it to your server, **for example**:

```bash
https://YOUR-CLOUDFLARE-PAGES-URL.pages.dev/script
```

### Deploy to Vercel

1. Upload your project to [`Github`](https://github.com) or [`Gitlab`](https://gitlab.com)

2. Import your repository into [`Vercel`](https://vercel.com/new) from [`Add new -> Project`](https://vercel.com/new)

3. Select your repository and set the configuration as follows:

![Vercel Build Settings](https://i.gyazo.com/fd1c43291967d4cd518383183711cf10.png)

4. Copy the generated URL by `Cloudflare Pages` and connect it to your server, **for example**:

```bash
https://YOUR-VERCEL-URL.vercel.app/script
```

## In-Server Script Editor

For basic scripts, you can use the in-server script editor, it's a lightweight editor that allows you to write and run scripts directly in your server with no need to host or deploy your script.

To open the `Script Editor`, use `CTRL + SHIFT + J` or go to the **Scripts** tab in your **Server's Settings**. Then, click on `Toggle Script Editor`

## Manual Build & Deploy (Advanced)

:::caution
Manual build & deploy not recommended for `Client` and `WebServer` scripts, we suggest to deploy to one of the platforms mentioned above, you don't need any extra configurations with deploying to one of the platforms mentioned above.
:::

If you're a fearless developer and want to host your script in your own hosting platform, you can do so by building your script manually.

To build your script manually, run the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a `dist` and `api` folder with your scripts ready to be deployed, the `dist` folder will contain the client scripts and the `api` folder will contain the server scripts.

For the `Client Scripts` you can use any static hosting platform, for the `Server Scripts` you will need to host them in a platform that supports serverless functions or a node http server.
